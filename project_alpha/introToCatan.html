          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Settlers of Catan is a game made by German game maker Klaus Teuber. Imagining how European Viking
            settlers sailed to and settled on near by islands inspired Mr. Teuber to create this trading
            and building strategy game.
          </p>
          <p>Each player is the leader of a tribe starting with two settlements. Using the resources of the
            island--mainly brick/clay, wood/lumber, wheat, sheep/wool, and ore-- players build roads, settlements, and cities, purchase soldliers/knights, steal from other
            players, and trade resources in order to become the ruling Lord/Lady of the island of Catan.  </p>
        </section>
        <section class="blog">
          <h3>General actions per turn</h3>
          <p>
            <img class="blogImage" ALIGN="top" src="https://www.starlitcitadel.com/games/media//IMG_1372_1.jpg" alt="building costs">
              After the island has been set up, starting player has been decided, starting settlements have been placed, and
            starting resources have been alocated, the game officially begins with the starting player. For more information
            about set up, please refer to <a href="https://www.catan.com/en/download/?SoC_rv_Rules_091907.pdf">the Catan instruction manual</a>.
          </p>
          <p>On each turn, the player would roll 2 dice. If the number rolled is not a 7, each player that has
            a settlement next to a resource tile with the corresponding dice roll would gain one
             of that resource per settlement next to the rolled number tile.
             Likewise, each player that has a city next to a resource title
            with the corresponding dice roll will get 2 of that resourece per city next to rolled number tile.
            For example, if some rolled a 4 on their turn, and I have a city next to an ore tile with a 4
            on it and a city next to a sheep tile with a 4 on it, I would get 2 ore cards and 1 sheep card from
            that person's roll. If a player rolls a seven, any one who has 8 or more resource cards,
            will have to discard half their hand. After discards are completed, the player who rolled the seven,
            can move the humanoid grey (edition 2 or 3) or black (edition 1) pawn on the board known as the robber
             on to a resource tile, which prevents resources from being produced
             from that tile, until the robber is moved again.
            Additionally, if there are settlements or cities next to robber, the player who moved the robber,
            can steal one random resorce from a player whose settlement or city is next to the robber.
            <img class="blogImageRight" ALIGN="top" src="http://www.ultracatan.com/gfx/longest-road.jpg" alt="Longest Road">
          </p>
          <p> After everyone has collected their resources via dice roll or stealing via the robber, then
            the player who rolled, can either build cities, roads, or settlements, purchase or play development
            cards, or trade with other players or the bank. Roads cost a brick/clay and a wood/lumber and settlements
            cost a brick/clay, a wood/lumber, a sheep/wool, and a wheat. Settlements must always be connected
            to roads, and settlements must always be at least 2 road spaces away from other settlements. One can
            upgrade a settlement into a city using three ore cards and two wheat cards. As mentioned in the previous
            paragraph, settlments produce 1 resource per roll and cities produce 2 resources per roll. Additionally,
            setllements are worth 1 victory point and cities are worth 2 victory points. The first person
            who builds an
            uninterupted route of 5 road pieces claims the "Longest Road" award, which is worth 2
            victory points. The "Longest Road" award can only be taken, if a player builds a longer uninterepted road. For more
            information about victory points, see the
            <a href="#HowToWin">How to win</a>
            section below.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to purchasing/building roads, settlements, and cities, players can purchase development
            cards for the cost of one ore, one wheat, and one sheep/wool per development card. Players can
            purchase as many development cards at once, but they can only play one development card, per turn.
            Among the 25 development cards in a 3-4 person game, there are these cards:
            <ul>
              <li>2 monopoly cards, which allows the player steal all the
                  resources of one type from all other players</li>
              <li>2 road building cards, which allows the player to build 2 free roads</li>
              <li>2 year of plenty cards, which allows the player to take 2 free resources
                from the bank of any type
              </li>
              <li>5 victory point cards, which each are worth 1 victory point. (See the
                  <a href="#HowToWin">How to win</a>
                section below for more details on victory points)</li>
              <li>14 soldlier/knight cards</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="blogImageRight" src="http://www.ultracatan.com/gfx/largest-army.jpg" alt="Largest Army">
            Soldlier/Knight cards allow players to move the robber to another resource tile and steal
            a resource from a player who has a settlement or city next to the robber's new location. As
            mentioned earlier, resource tiles blocked by the robber do not produce resources, until the
            robber is moved again via a 7 roll or another soldlier/knight card. The first to play 3 soldlier/knight
            cards earns the "Largest Army" award. Like the "Longest Road" award, it is worth 2 points,
            and be taken by a person who creates a larger army. For more information about victory points
            see the
            <a href="#HowToWin">How to win</a>
            section below.
          </p>
          <p>
            Roads, settlements, cities, and development cards cost resoruces, and at times, it is hards
            to obtain the resources to get them. Thus, trading with other players, the bank, and the ports
            are esential in doing well in the game. When it comes to trading between players, trades either
            have to involve the active player (the person who rolled the dice for that turn). (e.g. if
            you want to trade with someone, it has to be that person's turn or your turn). Additionally,
            one could trade with the bank, trading in four of one resource for one desired resource. If a person
            is next to one of the nine ports, he/she/they can make a reduced deal with the bank according to
            <a href="https://www.catan.com/en/download/?SoC_rv_Rules_091907.pdf">the Catan instruction manual</a>.

                <h3>How to win</h3>
                <img id="victoryPointPicture" class="blogImage" ALIGN="top" src="https://i1.wp.com/gameknight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/victorypoint.png?ssl=1" alt="victoryPoints">
                <p>
                  To claim to the victorious title of Lord/Lady of Catan, one must be the first player
                  to create a kingdom worth 10 victory points. Each settlement is one victory point; however,
                  due to supplies, the maximum number of settlements one could have is 5 settlements. Players
                  can upgrade settlements to cities, which each city is worth 2 points, allowing players to reclaim
                  settlement pieces to build another settlement; however, each player can build up to a maximum of
                  4 cities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to settlements and cities one could gain victory points through awards. The first to
                  build an uninterupted route of 5 road pieces can claim the Longest Road award. If anyone builds a
                  longer uninterupted route than the holder of the Longest Road award, they can take that award from
                  the current award holder. Likewise, the first to play 3 soldlier/knight cards can claim the Largest
                  Army award, and if someone plays more soldlier/knight cards than the Largest Army award holder, they
                  can take away the Largest Army award from the holder. Both Longest Road and Largest Army awards are
                  worth 2 points each.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, 5 of the purchasable development cards are victory point cards, which are worth 1 hidden victory
                  point each.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the combination of settlements, cities, awards, and victory point cards, the first to 10 victory
                  points becomes Lord/Lady of Catan and wins the game.
