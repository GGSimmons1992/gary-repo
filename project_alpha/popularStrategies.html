                <h3>Securing Success</h3>
                <img src="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/thmb/SKc37iGoW4h7OOguSkT88DdM80k=/450x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/how-to-win-at-settlers-of-catan-board-game-412417_final-5b562f924cedfd003714a7d9.png" alt="Tips on Thriving in Catan" class="blogImage">
                <p>There a 4 common stragies one can secure success in the base Settlers of Catan game. These
                  strategies can be known as Largest Army or Development Card Strategy, Longest Road or Manifest Destiny, Urbanization, and
                  monopoly/mono-culture.
                </p>
                <h4>Largest Army or Development Card Strategy</h4>
                <img class="blogImageRight" src="http://www.ultracatan.com/gfx/development-cards.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The largest army strategy highly focuses on development cards, hence it relies heavily on
                  sheep, wheat, and ore. The focus is to purchase enough development cards to claim largest army
                  and keep it. In pursuing largest army, one collects other development cards that would help a
                  player build more settlements and cities and victory point cards help edge in a victory. Also,
                  not playing the soldier/knight cards immediately, but by playing them defensivly kicking the robber
                  off of your property reduces resource blocking time for your settlements and building.
                </p>
                <p>When pursuing this strategy one must be wary of these 2 warnings:
                  <ol>
                    <li>Try not to take largest army too early</li>
                    <li>Once largest army is claimed, focus more on building settlements and cities
                      unless claim to largest army is threatened
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  Claiming largest army too early provoke players to attack you, especially since soldlier/knight
                  cards aim at stealing and attacking other players, and claiming largest army brings attention to
                  oneself by claiming a 2 point award early in the game. Also, as one has the largest army, one
                  needs to move to building settlements and cities. Largest army only gives 2 victory points, and
                  there are only 5 victory point cards in the 25 card development card deck. The goal is to gain 10
                  points and the same resources used purchase 3 development cards can create 1 city.

                  (Personally, this is Gary Garth Simmons' favorite stategy)
                </p>
                <h4>Longest Road or Manifest Destiny</h4>
                <img class="blogImage" src="http://www.ultracatan.com/gfx/longest-road.jpg" alt="">
                <p>This strategy focuses more on building lots of roads and settlements. Many of my friends
                  and family members focus more on this strategy. Since this path requires lots of roads, those
                  who follow this strategy rely on brick/clay and wood/lumber. The idea here is to build enough roads
                  to claim enough land grabs. In the base game, once a road is laid down, it is permenantly claimed, thus
                  opportunites to claim certain parts of the island become cut off to the slow. Then, one can actually build
                  settlements at their own pace. Also, since this strategy requires a heavy production of wood and brick
                  this strategy provides adequate resources to build settlements. Lastly, like the Largest Army
                  this method can easily help one acquire the two point longest road award. The downside of this strategy is that if one claims longest road too early, this will lead
                  to many attacks and embargoes.
                </p>
                <h4>Urbanization</h4>
                <img class="blogImageRight" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/22/12/cc2212177958bfa91e96c2f5527554af.png" alt="">
                <p>
                  The urbanization strategy focuses a lot on city building, hence it will need a lot of wheat and ore.
                  Since cities double the amount of resources produced, building cities early in the game, a player can
                  generate an overwhelming surplus of resources. The
                  surplus helps one a lot in building and trade. The risk in this strategy is that oponents will target
                  more robber attacks on tiles that help your city. Various other sites and videos and suggest the
                  urbanization strategy often state that "cities attract more crime" than peaceful settlements.
                </p>

                <h4>monopoly/mono-culutre</h4>
                <img class="blogImage" src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/202002532043-0-1/s-l1000.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                  The last strategy mentioned on this page has helped various people who pay attention to the
                  location of resource tiles and the location of ports. By focusing on one resource type, a player
                  can amass a lot of one resource. Like the urbanization strategy this will help one in building and
                  trade, especially if there is a shortage of that one particular resource. By claiming multiple
                  settlements and cities next to that one resource, there is a high probability that players following
                  this strategy will have that one particular resource while everyone does not. In addition, this strategy
                  massively improves, if one has the proper ports, allowing easy trade deals to happen more frequently.
                  The monopoly/mono-culture strategy works really well with wheat, because settlements, cities, and
                  development cards rely on wheat. Thus if there is a shortage on wheat, a person with a monopoly of wheat
                  can jack up wheat prices. If said wheat monopoly player also has the wheat port, there is no need for a
                  him/her/them to trade with the other players due to the wheat discount. The downside of this strategy is if
                  this person focuses on one resource and does not have a port, there will be a struggle to acquire the
                  other resources needed to win until a port is obtained.

          <h3>Preventing Impovershment</h3>
          <!-- <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/d7ea111763a170bc21972b86ab9f36bb/tenor.gif?itemid=6138481" alt="Don't Struggle" class="blogImage"> -->
          <p>
            For many beginners, growing one's kingdom may be a difficult struggle, especially if one does
            not settle in the correct places, has terrible trading skills, or provokes too many attacks
            and/or emargoes on his/her/their kingdom. Thus, this section is dedicated to advise one how
            to survive on the island. For tips on succesfully thriving, please jump to the
            <a href="#success">Securing Success</a> section
          </p>
          <h4>Settlement Placement</h4>
          <p>There are 3 factors one should consider in where to put settlements for both the
            beginning and middle of the game: resource number, resource type, and port location.
            In the beginning, players should settle next to tiles with highly probable rolled numbers. In other
            words, players should start their first two settlements near 8's, 6's, 9's, and 5's (maybe 10's and 4's
            if initial settlement choices gets too competative). As the game continues, one should place newer settlements
            next to numbers and resources they did not start off with to gain higher probabilities of receiving resources.
            <p>
                In addition, one should look if there are nearby
                ports corresponding with resources they produce often enough (e.g. if one produces a lot of sheep,
                they should either find the sheep port and/or a general 3 for 1 port). If they are near a port corresponding
                to a resource that produces a lot, they should strive to settling a that port as soon as possible.
            </p>
             Lastly, a player should go for either diversity or mono-culture for resource type. Diversity refers to aiming to
            produce at least one of each type of resource early in the game, while mono-culture refers to building next
            to as many tiles of one type, (e.g. builing next to as many wheat tiles, so one becomes as my friends would
            say the "king/queen of wheat"). Diversity strategy ensures that one can at least produce each resource without
            depending too much on trading with other people or the bank and the mono-culture allows more frequent trades
            with the bank to secure other resources
          </p>
          <p>By paying attention to number, resource type, and port location, one can become self-sufficeint
            and not depending on begging other players to provide resources just to get by.
          </p>
          <h4> Expanding vertically and horizonatlly fast</h4>
          <p>
            The name of the game is expansion via both settlements and cities. By building roads and settlements at a
            fast pace, one could secure land fast and produce many resources fast in both number and type. If one can
            build cities fast, they can produce large quantities of resource allowing more opportunities to trade
            with the bank and other players.
          </p>
          <h4>Don't provoke people and hide successes if possible</h4>
          <p>
            Though Catan is a very competative game, it's also an interactive game. You have to get along, or at least
            appear to get along with the other players on the island, else trade deals will fail and more robber and
            knight attacks upon one's kingdom will occur more frequently.</p>

            <p>Also, if you appear to be winning, more
            attacks and embargoes will ensue. In other words, hide in the background. Try not to bulid longest road too
            early, don't draw attention to yourself when earning victory points, direct oponents' attention to player's
            successes. Most players will attack and embargo those who are attracting too much attention, allowing those
            who hide in the background to sneak in a victory from behind.
          </p>
          <h4>Trade Smarter</h4>
          <p>
            When trading, have goals and plans. If a trade does not get you closer to those goals or plans, do not
            accept the trade. Without a goal in mind, a trade can hurt you and help other players get closer to their
            goals. Also, if you notice a player 1-3 victory points to winning, do not trade with them. They have enough
            methods of acquiring resources, that trading with them will more likely help them more than help you more.
